							<p>Most people shouldn’t buy a high-end gaming laptop right now. Laptops with RTX 2070 or 2080 graphics cards cost more than $2,000 and don’t provide a worthwhile upgrade from a $1,200 laptop with a 1660 Ti, which is what most people should get. But if you’re looking for a laptop that’s thinner and lighter than those, fits comfortably into a laptop bag, and can play games at similar frame rates, get the Acer Predator Triton 500 PT515-51-75BH with RTX 2060 graphics.

					<p>The UE Wonderboom 2 is as euphonious as Ariana Grande but as tough as Lara Croft. In our blind tests, our panelists picked this Bluetooth speaker as the all-around most versatile choice. With clear vocal reproduction and a decent amount of bass for its size, it offers satisfying sound for small areas. It has an IP67 rating and is one of the most rugged Bluetooth speakers we’ve tested, able to survive a 5-foot drop and a dunking in 1 meter of water—but because it floats, it’ll probably never dive that deep. The Wonderboom 2’s only downside is its battery life, which at 8 hours is adequate but not impressive. We like the Wonderboom 2’s compact design, even if the almost-spherical shape makes this model a little tougher to pack away in a suitcase pocket or laptop bag.</p>

					<p>I’ve reviewed audio gear professionally since 1990. I have written reviews for numerous magazines and websites, including Sound & Vision, Home Theater Review, Mashable, Lifewire, and Home Theater. I’ve probably conducted more blind tests of audio products than any other journalist, and I’ve tested somewhere around 380 wireless speakers to date. Since 2008 I have taken portable Bluetooth speakers on more than 100 trips, from bike tours to transoceanic junkets to weeklong trade-show slogs.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Who should buy a portable Bluetooth speaker</h2>
					<p>Anyone who owns a smartphone or tablet would probably enjoy owning a portable Bluetooth speaker, which can improve the listening experience anywhere. Bluetooth is available in every current smartphone and tablet, as well as in most laptop computers, so you don’t need additional equipment. Unlike smart speakers and Wi-Fi speakers, Bluetooth speakers don’t require a network connection and the use of special apps—whatever you play on the phone will play through the speaker.</p>
					<p>Portable Bluetooth speakers have a rechargeable battery and are frequently waterproof or splash-proof, so you can easily move them around the house or take them to a park or the beach. We’ve found that they make hotel rooms feel more like home.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Competition</h2>
					<p>We’ve tested about 290 portable Bluetooth speakers specifically for this article. Some competitors came close to our top picks in performance and value, and they may be worth considering, depending on your priorities. Here’s a list of some of the more recent models we’ve considered, in alphabetical order.</p>
					<p>The circular <a href="#">1More Portable BT Speaker</a> produced distorted bass, made voices sound unnatural, and seemed to vibrate a bit on the table we placed it on.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#">Altec Lansing Rock Box XL</a> generally sounds very good and plays pretty loud. We prefer the more compact form factors of the JBL Xtreme 2 and Sony SRS-XB43, but if you like the boombox format, the Rock Box XL is a good buy.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#"> Altec Lansing SoundBucket XL </a> is what it says it is—a big, bucket-shaped speaker. It’s surprisingly inexpensive, it plays about as loud as the much costlier Sony SRS-XB43, and it’s IP67-rated. It has a dull sound that makes voices sound somewhat muffled and bloated, but if you just need a high-volume speaker for pool parties and understandably want to pay as little as possible, it’s a good buy.</p>
					<p>Although we found that the <a href="#">Altec Lansing Super Life Jacket</a> played loud and had impressive bass for its size, we thought the sound was rather rough and uneven.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#">Anker SoundCore </a> has a low price and an appealingly simple design, but it didn’t sound as full and smooth as the Tribit XSound Go.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#"> Anker SoundCore Boost </a> loses voice clarity with its bass boost mode activated, but without it, we thought the bass was usually lacking.</p>
					<p>We thought the tiny Anker SoundCore Icon Mini didn’t play loud or clear or full enough to warrant the investment.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#"> Anker SoundCore Motion+ </a> plays very loud for its size and cost, but voices have a boosted, unnatural quality, and the bass doesn’t cut it for hip-hop and pop.</p>
					<p>Our panelists preferred the <a href="#"> Tribit XSound </a>Go to the Anker SoundCore Motion B, but all thought the Motion B sounded pretty good—and it is an excellent value.</p>
					<p>Our panelists thought the <a href="#"> Aomais Go </a> had a nice, full sound and a reasonable price, but they thought it was rather bulky for the volume it delivered.</p>
					<p>We liked the clarity of the <a href="#"> Audioengine 512 </a> on vocals and most instruments, but thought its bass and lower midrange weren’t strong enough to handle most hip-hop and heavy rock.</p>
					<p>Our panelists loved the sound of the <a href="#"> B&O Beoplay A1</a>, but they lost their enthusiasm when they saw its high price.</p>
					<p>We like the <a href="#"> Bose SoundLink Color II</a> a lot. We think the Sony SRS-XB33 and Soundcore Rave Neo sound more powerful, but if you want something more compact and colorful, the SoundLink Color II is a good choice.</p>
					<p>The <a href="#"> Bose SoundLink Micro </a> sounds surprisingly full for its size, but for its price it doesn’t play all that loud.</p>
